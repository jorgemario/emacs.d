## Fork of Bozhidar's Emacs config
Added personal preferences on top of original config.
* Different theme and font
* Removed ruby/elixir support
* Added iedit, clj-refactor, powerline, helm, etc
* Added/changed some keybindings
* Use of modular config (core, programming, ui, etc)
* Using "simo" prefix (will name the conf in a future refactor)
  * simo-emacs
